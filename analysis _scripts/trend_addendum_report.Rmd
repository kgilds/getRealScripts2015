# Introduction 

The following academic data reflects slight changes from the May 1st report. The changes reflect a change in the number of successful matches. For instance, a student record may have been entered into Qualtrics with just a reading grade but no attendance data.  

This report also has trend data from students who particpated in the Get REAL! program last year. The number of students that could be matched is 68 and most have very positive outcomes. Nearly 2/3 have increased grades or maintained a C average in Language Arts. Almost 100% have decreased or reduced suspenions and 81 percent have improved their attendance.
